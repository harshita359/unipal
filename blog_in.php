                                    <p><strong>PR Release – July 2023 – Unipal</strong></p>
                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Bahrain-born startup, Unipal, has secured a half a million-dollar funding round, with the aim of taking over the capital city of Riyadh, and then expanding into Eastern Province and Jeddah. The funding round was led
                                        by Flat6labs &amp; Tenmou, who both doubled down on their initial investments, and was joined by the European-based student platform, GTS Alive, and other Angel investors.</p>
                                    <p>Launched in 2020, Unipal has already acquired 74% of the student population in Bahrain. With this latest round of funding, the startup aims to replicate this success across the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Unipal's CEO &amp; Co-founder, Ali Alalawi, said:</p>
                                    <blockquote>
                                        <p>"This funding round is a testament to the potential for growth in Saudi. We're excited to take on the challenge of expanding into Riyadh, and ultimately across the country and beyond. We're confident we can create
                                            something truly special that will benefit businesses &amp; students across the region."</p>
                                    </blockquote>
                                    <p>Unipal's success in Bahrain has been driven by its innovative platform, where brands get direct access to students and offer exclusive discounts on the App. The startup's unique approach has been well-received by students
                                        and businesses alike, and it is hoped that this success will be replicated in Saudi Arabia. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>The next round of funding is set to open in early 2024, as Unipal looks to continue its expansion across the region. With the support of its investors, Unipal is well-positioned to become the leading student platform
                                        in the Middle East and beyond.</p>
